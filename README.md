# MMTTY

This source code repository has been forked from MMTTY repository of
[7M4KSC](https://github.com/7M4KSC/mmtty) which, in turn, has forked it from the
repository of origin when MMTTY has been open sourced. The intent of this fork is
to review and fix a number of issues, especially related to premature PTT dropping
during FSK transmissions, as described on MMTTY and DXLog groups.io reflectors.

Please note that the most current branch is the main-dev branch.

To build this project you will require Embarcadero C++ Builder. Unfortunately,
MMTTY has been created using an old version that is no longer
avaialble. Recompiling it using newer versions may produce unintended
results. However, the development of this fork intends to use the most recent
version of Embarcadero C++ Builder Community Edition if at all possible. Ideally,
the project would be ported to an open source development environment one day.

For more information about open sourcing of MMTTY please see
